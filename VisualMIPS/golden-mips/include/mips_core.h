/*! \file 
    The <stdint.h> header gives us types of a known width and signedness, like
    uint32_t and int16_t. These types can be very useful for
    matching the internal types of a processor, and for managing
    conversions from signed to unsigned types. The C/C++ standard has certain
    (very strict) rules for conversion between types, which are different from
    the rules of any particular CPU. In an extremely legalitic interpretation, the
    integer encoding is not necessarily twos complement, but we
    will mandate that all target architectures use a twos complement
    representation.
